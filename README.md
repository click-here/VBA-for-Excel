# VBA-for-Excel

Handy VBA functions for Excel I've written over the years. 

[Special Concat](special_concate.vb) - In a previous job after exporting survey data we would often be left with very wide Excel files. Survey questions like "Which of the following 50 makeup products do you use?" would consume 50 columns with values simply being "Yes" or "No".  This function creates a way to concate each of the "Yes" answers into a single cell pulling in what the question text was. Unclear what this is to be used for? Check out [this screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/click-here/VBA-for-Excel/master/img/specconcat.png) of how it should be implemented.
